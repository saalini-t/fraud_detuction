## 🚀 Overview
Our system continuously monitors blockchain transactions, leveraging machine learning to detect anomalies and assign fraud probability scores in real-time. It generates instant alerts for suspicious transactions and provides detailed reports for compliance and forensic analysis.

### Key Features:
- Real-time monitoring of blockchain transactions  
- Behavioral analysis for anomaly detection  
- Fraud probability scoring with alerts  
- Comprehensive reporting & audit trails

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### **Frontend**
- **React with TypeScript** → Modern, component-based architecture  
- **Shadcn/ui & Tailwind CSS** → Consistent styling and responsive design  
- **WebSockets** → Live updates & instant user notifications  

### **Backend**
- **Express.js with TypeScript** → Secure and scalable fraud detection core  
- **Multi-Agent Pattern** → Specialized agents for real-time detection  
- **WebSockets** → Real-time communication of alerts  
- **Session-based Authentication** → Secure user management with audit trails  

---

## 🧑‍💻 The Agents
- **Transaction Monitor** → Polls blockchain data every 5s  
- **Behavior Analysis** → Detects anomalies every 10s  
- **Risk Scoring** → Assigns fraud probability every 8s using ML  
- **Reporting Agent** → Generates compliance reports every 30s  

---

## 🗄️ Data Foundation
- **PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM** → Reliable, scalable database  
- **Type-Safe ORM** → Robust database operations  
- **Optimized Indexing** → Fast queries on critical fields like transaction hashes & wallet addresses  

---

## 🔗 Real-Time Communication
- **WebSockets** push live updates (alerts, transactions, agent status)  
- Automatic reconnection for resilience  
- Ensures immediate response to threats  

---

## 📦 External Dependencies
